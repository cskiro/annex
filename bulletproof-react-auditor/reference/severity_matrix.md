# Severity Matrix

Priority levels and response times for Bulletproof React audit findings.

## Severity Levels

### Critical (P0)
**Fix immediately (within 24 hours)**

#### Criteria
- Security vulnerabilities (tokens in localStorage, XSS risks)
- Breaking architectural violations that prevent scalability
- No testing framework in production app
- TypeScript strict mode disabled with widespread `any` usage

#### Examples
- Authentication tokens stored in localStorage
- No error boundaries in production app
- Zero test coverage on critical paths
- Multiple cross-feature dependencies creating circular imports

#### Impact
- Security breaches possible
- Application instability
- Cannot safely refactor or add features
- Technical debt compounds rapidly

---

### High (P1)
**Fix this sprint (within 2 weeks)**

#### Criteria
- Major architectural misalignment with Bulletproof React
- No data fetching library (manual API state management)
- Test coverage < 80%
- Large components (> 400 LOC) with multiple responsibilities
- No features/ directory with >50 components

#### Examples
- Flat structure instead of feature-based
- Scattered fetch calls throughout components
- No React Query/SWR for server state
- Components with 15+ props
- No error tracking service (Sentry)

#### Impact
- Difficult to maintain and extend
- Poor developer experience
- Slow feature development
- Bugs hard to track and fix
- Testing becomes increasingly difficult

---

### Medium (P2)
**Fix next quarter (within 3 months)**

#### Criteria
- Component design anti-patterns
- State management could be improved
- Missing recommended directories
- Some cross-feature imports
- No code splitting
- Inconsistent styling approaches

#### Examples
- Components 200-400 LOC
- Context with 5+ state values
- Too many shared components (should be feature-specific)
- Nested render functions instead of components
- Multiple styling systems in use
- Large images not optimized

#### Impact
- Code is maintainable but could be better
- Some technical debt accumulating
- Refactoring is more difficult than it should be
- Performance could be better
- Developer onboarding takes longer

---

### Low (P3)
**Backlog (schedule when convenient)**

#### Criteria
- Minor deviations from Bulletproof React patterns
- Stylistic improvements
- Missing nice-to-have features
- Small optimizations

#### Examples
- Files not using kebab-case naming
- No Prettier configured
- No git hooks (Husky)
- Missing some recommended directories
- Test naming doesn't follow "should X when Y"
- Some components could be better colocated

#### Impact
- Minimal impact on development
- Minor inconsistencies
- Small developer experience improvements possible
- Low-priority technical debt

- Setting up comprehensive error handling
- Improving test coverage to 80%

### High Effort (1-3 weeks)
- Complete architecture restructuring

## Category-Specific Severity Guidelines

### Structure Issues
- **Critical**: No features/, flat structure with 100+ components
- **High**: Missing features/, cross-feature dependencies
- **Medium**: Some organizational issues
- **Low**: Minor folder organization improvements

### Component Issues
- **Critical**: Components > 1000 LOC, widespread violations
- **High**: Many components > 400 LOC, 15+ props
- **Medium**: Some large components, nested renders
- **Low**: Minor design improvements needed

### State Management
- **Critical**: No proper state management in complex app
- **High**: No data fetching library, manual API state
- **Medium**: State could be better localized
- **Low**: Could use better state management tool

### Testing Issues
- **Critical**: No testing framework, 0% coverage
- **High**: Coverage < 50%, wrong test distribution
- **Medium**: Coverage 50-79%, some brittle tests
- **Low**: Coverage > 80%, minor test improvements

### Security Issues
- **Critical**: Tokens in localStorage, XSS vulnerabilities
