# Changelog

All notable changes to the Bulletproof React Auditor skill will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-10-25

### Added
- **Core Infrastructure**
  - Bulletproof React audit engine with 3-phase analysis (Discovery → Analysis → Scoring)
  - CLI interface with multiple output formats (Markdown, JSON, HTML planned)
  - Automatic React project detection and tech stack discovery
  - Compliance scoring system (0-100 scale with A-F grades)

- **10 Specialized Analyzers**
  1. **project_structure**: Feature-based vs flat structure, cross-feature imports, folder organization
  2. **component_architecture**: Component size, prop count, colocation, naming conventions
  3. **state_management**: State tool selection, localization patterns, server cache detection
  4. **api_layer**: API client centralization, scattered fetch detection, type safety
  5. **testing_strategy**: Coverage analysis, testing trophy distribution, semantic queries
  6. **styling_patterns**: Consistency checks, component library detection
  7. **error_handling**: Error boundaries, tracking services, interceptors
  8. **performance_patterns**: Code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization
  9. **security_practices**: Token storage, XSS prevention, input sanitization
  10. **standards_compliance**: ESLint, TypeScript strict mode, Prettier, Husky

- **Reference Documentation**
  - `audit_criteria.md`: Complete 10-category compliance checklist
  - `severity_matrix.md`: Priority levels (P0-P3), effort estimation, response times
  - `SKILL.md`: Comprehensive skill definition with usage instructions
  - `README.md`: User-facing documentation with examples

- **Example Outputs**
  - `sample_audit_report.md`: Full audit report with 47 findings across all severity levels
  - Demonstrates structure comparison (current vs target)
  - Shows migration roadmap with timeline
  - Includes affected files and migration steps

### Features
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Quick (Phase 1 only) vs Full analysis modes
- **Scoped Analysis**: Run specific analyzers via `--scope` flag
- **Actionable Findings**: Each finding includes:
  - Current state vs target state
  - Step-by-step migration guidance
  - Effort estimation (low/medium/high)
  - Affected files list
  - Severity level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Integration Ready**:
  - CLI for standalone use
  - Claude Code skill for conversational audits
  - JSON output for CI/CD integration
- **Connor's Standards**:
  - 80%+ test coverage enforcement
  - Testing trophy distribution (70% integration)
  - TypeScript strict mode checks
  - No console.log detection

### Technical Details
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Dependencies**: None (uses Python standard library only)
- **Lines of Code**: ~3,000 lines
- **File Count**: 17 files
- **Architecture**: Modular analyzer pattern for easy extension

### Success Criteria Met
- ✅ Audits complete in <60 seconds for typical React app
- ✅ Identifies all major Bulletproof React deviations
- ✅ Generates actionable migration plans with effort estimates
- ✅ Provides clear structure diagrams (ASCII in example)
- ✅ Integrates with Connor's existing standards (80% coverage, testing trophy)
- ✅ Can be run via Claude Code or CLI
- ✅ Produces reports in Markdown format (JSON/HTML planned)

### Installation
```bash
# Installed to ~/.claude/skills/bulletproof-react-auditor/
# Available for use via Claude Code
```

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Full audit
python scripts/audit_engine.py /path/to/react-app

# Quick health check
python scripts/audit_engine.py /path/to/react-app --phase quick

# Scoped analysis
python scripts/audit_engine.py /path/to/react-app --scope structure,components,testing

# JSON output
python scripts/audit_engine.py /path/to/react-app --format json --output audit.json
```

### Known Limitations
- Static analysis only (no runtime profiling)
- React 16.8+ required (hooks-based apps)
- Best suited for SPA/SSG patterns (Next.js has some different patterns)
- Large codebases (>1000 files) may need scoped analysis
- HTML report format not yet implemented

### Future Enhancements (Potential v1.1)
- HTML dashboard with interactive visualizations
- Report generator for migration plans
- Integration with Bulletproof React sample app for reference
- Auto-fix capabilities for simple violations
- Git diff analysis for incremental audits
- CI/CD GitHub Action
- VS Code extension
