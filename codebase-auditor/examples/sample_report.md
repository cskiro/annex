## Detailed Findings

### üö® CRITICAL (2 issues)

#### Potential API key found in code

**Category**: Security
**Subcategory**: secrets
**Location**: `src/utils/api.ts:12`

Found potential secret on line 12

```typescript
const API_KEY = "sk_live_[REDACTED_FOR_SECURITY]";
```

**Impact**: Exposed secrets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches

**Remediation**: Remove secret from code and use environment variables or secret management tools

**Effort**: LOW

---

#### Use of eval() is dangerous

**Category**: Security
**Subcategory**: code_security
**Location**: `src/legacy/parser.js:45`

Found on line 45

```javascript
const result = eval(userInput);
```

**Impact**: eval() can execute arbitrary code and is a security risk

**Remediation**: Refactor to avoid eval(), use safer alternatives like Function constructor with specific scope

**Effort**: MEDIUM

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH (8 issues)

#### High cyclomatic complexity (28)

**Category**: Code Quality
**Subcategory**: complexity
**Location**: `src/services/checkout.ts:156`

Function has complexity of 28

**Impact**: High complexity makes code difficult to understand, test, and maintain

**Remediation**: Refactor into smaller functions, extract complex conditions

**Effort**: HIGH

---

#### Line coverage below target (65.3%)

**Category**: Testing
**Subcategory**: test_coverage
**Location**: `coverage/coverage-summary.json`

Current coverage is 65.3%, target is 80%

**Impact**: Low coverage means untested code paths and higher bug risk

**Remediation**: Add tests to increase coverage by 14.7%

**Effort**: HIGH

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required**: Address all 2 critical security and quality issues before deploying to production.
2. **Sprint Focus**: Prioritize fixing the 8 high-severity issues in the next sprint. These significantly impact code quality and maintainability.
3. **Testing Improvements**: Increase test coverage to meet the 80% minimum threshold. Focus on critical paths first (authentication, payment, data processing).
4. **Security Review**: Conduct a thorough security review and penetration testing given the security issues found.
