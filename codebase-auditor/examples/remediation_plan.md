## Priority 0: Critical Issues (Fix Immediately âš¡)

**Timeline**: Within 24 hours
**Impact**: Security vulnerabilities, production-breaking bugs, data loss risks

### 1. Potential API key found in code
**Category**: Security
**Location**: `src/utils/api.ts`
**Effort**: LOW

**Issue**: Found potential secret on line 12

**Impact**: Exposed secrets can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches

**Action**: Remove secret from code and use environment variables or secret management tools

### 2. Use of eval() is dangerous
**Category**: Security
**Location**: `src/legacy/parser.js`
**Effort**: MEDIUM

**Issue**: Found on line 45

**Impact**: eval() can execute arbitrary code and is a security risk

**Action**: Refactor to avoid eval(), use safer alternatives like Function constructor with specific scope

## Priority 1: High Issues (Fix This Sprint ðŸ“…)

**Timeline**: Within current sprint (2 weeks)
**Impact**: Significant quality, security, or user experience issues

### 1. High cyclomatic complexity (28)
**Category**: Code Quality
**Effort**: HIGH

**Action**: Refactor into smaller functions, extract complex conditions

### 2. Line coverage below target (65.3%)
**Category**: Testing
**Effort**: HIGH

**Action**: Add tests to increase coverage by 14.7%

### 3. Long function (127 lines)
**Category**: Code Quality
**Effort**: MEDIUM

**Action**: Extract smaller functions for distinct responsibilities

### 4. Console statement in production code
**Category**: Code Quality
**Effort**: LOW
