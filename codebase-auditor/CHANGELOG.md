All notable changes to the Codebase Auditor skill will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2025-10-26

### Added
- Initial beta release of comprehensive codebase auditor
- **Code Quality Analysis**: Cyclomatic complexity, code duplication, code smells detection
- **Security Scanning**: OWASP Top 10 compliance checking, secret detection, CVE vulnerability scanning
- **Test Coverage Analysis**: Coverage metrics, test distribution analysis, coverage gaps identification
- **Dependency Management**: Vulnerability scanning, license compliance checking, outdated dependency detection
- **Performance Analysis**: Build time optimization, runtime performance patterns, CI/CD pipeline analysis
- **Technical Debt Assessment**: SQALE rating, debt categorization, remediation priority scoring
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Markdown reports (human-readable), JSON reports (CI/CD integration), HTML dashboards (visualization)
- **Prioritized Remediation Plans**: Actionable fix recommendations with effort estimates
- **Standards Compliance**: Based on 2024-25 SDLC best practices (OWASP, WCAG, DORA metrics)

### Features
- Modular analyzer architecture for extensibility
- Reference materials included for audit criteria
- Severity matrix for issue prioritization
- Example reports and remediation plans
- Python 3.8+ compatibility

### Known Limitations
- Tested on 1-2 projects only (proof of concept phase)
- Primary focus on Python/JavaScript/TypeScript codebases
- Security scanning relies on static analysis (no runtime analysis)
- Dependency vulnerability checking requires internet connection
- Performance analysis focuses on common patterns (may miss project-specific issues)

### Documentation
- Comprehensive SKILL.md with usage instructions
- README with detailed feature descriptions
- Reference documentation for audit standards
- Example reports in `examples/` directory

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Standard Python libraries (no external dependencies for core functionality)
- Git repository for version control analysis

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
- Support for more languages (Go, Rust, Java, C#)
- Integration with popular CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
- Real-time monitoring mode for continuous auditing
- Custom audit rule configuration
- Team-specific severity thresholds
- Historical trend analysis
- Automated fix suggestions with code generation
- IDE integration for real-time feedback

### Under Consideration
- Machine learning-based pattern detection
- Cross-project comparative analysis
- License compatibility checking
- Architecture decision record (ADR) integration
- Dependency graph visualization
