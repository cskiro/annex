# Codebase Auditor

Perform comprehensive codebase audits using modern software engineering standards, detecting quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and technical debt while generating actionable remediation plans.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when you need to:
- Audit a codebase for quality, security, and maintainability issues
- Assess technical debt and estimate remediation effort
- Prepare a production readiness report
- Evaluate a legacy codebase for modernization
- Generate prioritized improvement recommendations
- Analyze SDLC maturity and DevOps practices

## Audit Scope

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment (Progressive Disclosure)

Start with a lightweight scan to understand the codebase:

1. **Project Discovery**
   - Identify tech stack, languages, frameworks, and build tools
   - Detect package managers and dependency files
   - Identify test frameworks and CI/CD configurations
   - Map directory structure and architectural patterns

2. **Quick Health Check**
   - Count total files, lines of code, and file types
   - Check for basic documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
   - Identify version control practices (git history quality)
   - Detect obvious red flags (secrets in code, massive files, etc.)

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis (Load on Demand)

Based on Phase 1 findings, perform targeted deep analysis:

#### 2.1 Code Quality Analysis

**Complexity Metrics:**
- Calculate cyclomatic complexity for functions/methods
- Identify overly complex code (complexity > 10 = warning, > 20 = critical)
- Measure cognitive complexity and nesting depth
- Detect long methods/functions (> 50 LOC)
- Find large files (> 500 LOC)

**Code Duplication:**
- Detect duplicate code blocks (> 6 lines repeated)
- Calculate duplication percentage (> 5% = concern)
- Identify copy-paste anti-patterns
- Find similar code that could be abstracted

**Code Smells:**
- God objects/classes (too many responsibilities)
- Feature envy (excessive coupling)
- Dead code (unused imports, variables, functions)
- Magic numbers and hard-coded values
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Missing error handling
- Console.log statements (production code)

**TypeScript/JavaScript Specific:**
- Use of `any` type (strict mode violations)
- Use of `var` instead of `const`/`let`
- Loose equality (`==` instead of `===`)
- Missing return type annotations
- Non-null assertions without justification

#### 2.2 Testing & Coverage Analysis

**Coverage Metrics:**
