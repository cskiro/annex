# Annex - Claude Code Skills

> A curated collection of experimental skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

This repository contains skills that extend Claude Code's capabilities for common software engineering tasks. Currently in proof-of-concept/beta phase with local testing.

## ✨ Featured: cc-insights (NEW!)

**Never lose a conversation again.** The cc-insights skill automatically indexes your Claude Code conversations with RAG-powered semantic search. Find past solutions, generate insight reports, and track development patterns—completely automatic.

```
"Search my conversations about React accessibility"
→ Returns ranked semantic matches with context

"Generate a weekly insights report"
→ Activity timeline, file hotspots, tool usage analytics
```

### Global Installation (Recommended)

Install skills globally to use them across all your projects:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/cskiro/annex.git

# Install a skill globally
cp -r annex/codebase-auditor ~/.claude/skills/

# Use in any project
cd /path/to/your-project
# In Claude Code, just ask: "Audit this codebase"
```

### Project-Local Installation

Install skills for a specific project only:

## How Skills Work

1. **Discovery**: Claude Code automatically scans `~/.claude/skills/` (global) and `.claude/skills/` (local)
2. **Loading**: Each skill has a `SKILL.md` file that Claude reads to understand capabilities
3. **Invocation**: Simply describe what you want in natural language
4. **Execution**: Claude uses the skill's scripts and reference materials to complete the task

## Creating Your Own Skills

See [SKILL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md](./docs/SKILL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on:
- Skill structure and conventions
- Writing effective `SKILL.md` files
- Testing and debugging skills
- Global vs. local skill installation

## Contributing

Have a useful skill to share? Contributions welcome!

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new directory for your skill (follow existing structure)
3. Include: `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, scripts, reference materials, examples
4. Submit a pull request

**Skill Quality Standards:**
- Clear documentation with examples
- Follows modern best practices (2024-25)
- Includes reference materials for context
- Documented code (testing in progress)

## Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Install frequently-used skills globally (`~/.claude/skills/`)
- Keep skill-specific docs in the skill directory
- Use descriptive natural language when invoking skills
- Review generated reports before taking action

⚠️ **Don't:**
- Commit `.claude/skills/` in projects (already in `.gitignore`)
- Store sensitive data in skill directories
- Modify global skills for project-specific needs (use local copy instead)
